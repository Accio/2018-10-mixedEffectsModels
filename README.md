A tutorial on mixed effects models in R

I would like to create a tutorial on mixed effects models in R, focusing on omics data analysis.

There are already many outstanding tutorials around for mixed effects models and their applications in other areas, for instance

* Winter, Bodo. “Linear Models and Linear Mixed Effects Models in R with Linguistic Applications.” ArXiv:1308.5499 [Cs], August 26, 2013. http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.5499.
* Sommet, Nicolas, and Davide Morselli. “Keep Calm and Learn Multilevel Logistic Modeling: A Simplified Three-Step Procedure Using Stata, R, Mplus, and SPSS.” International Review of Social Psychology 30, no. 1 (September 8, 2017). https://doi.org/10.5334/irsp.90.

And recently there are a few interesting applications of mixed effects models in bioinformatics and omics data analysis, which were reported to improve the performance of statistical inference, for instance

* Fonseka, Chamith Y., Deepak A. Rao, Nikola C. Teslovich, Susan K. Hannes, Kamil Slowikowski, Michael F. Gurish, Laura T. Donlin, et al. “Mixed Effects Association of Single Cells Identifies an Expanded Th1-Skewed Cytotoxic Effector CD4+ T Cell Subset in Rheumatoid Arthritis.” BioRxiv, March 14, 2018, 172403. https://doi.org/10.1101/172403.
* Froehlich, Fabian, Anita Reiser, Laura Fink, Daniel Woschee, Thomas Ligon, Fabian Theis, Joachim Raedler, and Jan Hasenauer. “Multi-Experiment Nonlinear Mixed Effect Modeling of Single-Cell Translation Kinetics after Transfection.” BioRxiv, March 20, 2018, 285478. https://doi.org/10.1101/285478.
* Dharmarajan, Lekshmi, Hans-Michael Kaltenbach, Fabian Rudolf, and Joerg Stelling. “A Simple and Flexible Computational Framework for Inferring Sources of Heterogeneity from Single-Cell Dynamics.” BioRxiv, June 8, 2018, 341867. https://doi.org/10.1101/341867.

Nevertheless, a tutorial focusing on mixed effect models and their applications in bioinformatics and computational biology, and particular in the context of drug discovery, is to my best knowledge still missing. 

This is my motivation to start this small project.
